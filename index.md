Welcome to my 90's style handcoded [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site! :3

I enjoy cyber-security, especially learning how to harden a system more so than being an epic skid. My secondary and complementary hobby is collecting and interpreting data, be it through normal statistics or rarely dEeP lEaRnInG. I have completed several internships, each focused on data science, cyber-security, or web development. For instance, I used vocal vibrations and deep learning to classify whether patients have vocal trauma while at MIT's [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)!

In my free time, I play Minecraft and write code to collect and analyze data to help my faction; I learn how to use different \*nixes, security tools, and decentralization technologies; and when I'm not in front of a screen I might be practicing Taekwondo. In the Holy Editor War I fight on the side of Vim under the banner of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/). My languages of choice are [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I never log onto Twitter unless I’m tweeting about a conference, so if you contact me on Twitter, don’t expect a fast response. Alternatively, if you want to contact me to talk about cyber-security, giving me a job, or liberating humanity, please reach me at [sebastianxhanus@gmail.com](mailto:sebastianxhanus@gmail.com)! If you’re super cool and 1337, you can suggest another medium for communication over email while using my PGP key.
