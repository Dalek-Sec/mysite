Welcome to my 90's style handcoded [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site! :3

I have completed several internships, each focused on data science, cyber-security, or web development. I even had the honor of interning in MIT's [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)!

In my free time, I play Minecraft and write code to collect and analyze data to help my faction; I learn how to use different *nixes, security tools, and decentralization technologies; and when I'm not in front of a screen I might be practicing Taekwondo.

In the Holy Editor War I fight on the side of Vim under the banner of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).

My languages of choice are [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

You can find this site mirrored on [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/): (Flog not yet up, but now we're both on a watchlist since I mentioned Freenet)
