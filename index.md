Welcome to my 90's style handcoded [Jekyll]() site! :3

I have completed several internships, each focused on data science, cyber-security, or web development. I even had the honor of interning in MIT's [CSAIL]()!

In my free time, I play Minecraft and write code to collect and analyze data to help my faction; I learn how to use different *nixes, security tools, and decentralization technologies; and when I'm not in front of a screen I might be practicing Taekwondo.

In the Holy Editor War I fight on the side of Vim under the banner of [NeoVim]().

My languages of choice are [Python]() and [Rust]().

You can find this site mirrored on [Freenet](): (Flog not yet up, but now we're both on a watchlist since I mentioned Freenet)
